Objectives:

If motion was detected, conected light will be lit. And after 20 s, the light will be out by default.

Delay time can be adjusted by Up/Down buttons or by IR remote. The change in timer duration will be displayed with 3-Digit 7-Segment LEDs. The LED display will be shut down after 5 s when the push button is not pressed.

Pressing on a push button or remote control will first light up the LED display. The next step will be to execute the corresponding command.

If the sensor detects any activity, the Pilot LED will light up. And pilot LED will switch off after 200ms.

By pressing the Save button, you can save the timer settings to EEPROM of ATmega328 microprocessor.

Press Play on Remote Control or On/Off Button to switch on or off without using the PIR Motion Sensor. You can use this feature to turn it on before you sleep at night. When you go to sleep, you can turn on the Motion Sensor system by using the Push Button or Remote Control.
